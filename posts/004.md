# This is what you sound like when you talk about federation

Look. You should stop putting your content on platforms owned by big companies. 

You just have to instantiate your presence on a pod. It's not a website. For the last time. It's a node. You just pick one with good federation hygiene... you check the bi-directional defederation logs for high-entropy semantic drift and check its moderation Galois field. This takes like five minutes. Its basic digital physics.

Then when you want to say something you dont "post". You propagate a hash-cascade. It's a completely different action. Your content globule is then notarized by its own quantum signature onto the distributed merkle-tree, tessellating it across every entangled gopher-tunnel your instance has handshaken with. It’s not hard. It just... propagates.

The timeline thing is the easiest part and everyone gets stuck on it. No one *reads* the federated timeline. It's a raw packet-flow. A firehose. You have to calibrate your cognitive shielding and just absorb its chronological state... you phase-shift into its rhythm. You just have to let the data wash over you. If you try to *read* it you'll give yourself a data-burn. Obviously... 

So yeah. It's a non-custodial user-sovereign communications protocol with a federated governance model. It's for everyday people. It's like owning the concept of the color blue but for data. I really dont know how else to explain this. its just how information works. You'll get use to it. Anyway... my relay's packet-loss is spiking so I have to go re-sync the substrate. It's very simple. I just have to SSH into the mainframe and run a few commands.
